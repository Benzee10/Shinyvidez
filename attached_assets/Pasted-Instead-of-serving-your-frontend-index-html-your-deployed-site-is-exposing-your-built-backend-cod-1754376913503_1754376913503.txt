Instead of serving your frontend (index.html), your deployed site is exposing your built backend code (e.g., server/index.ts) as static JS. That means:

Vercel is serving your API/server code as static assets instead of running them as serverless functions.

This is most likely because your backend wasn’t correctly configured as an API Function, or you bundled server files into your public build (dist/public).

You're using Express, which requires Vercel's @vercel/node serverless runtime.

✅ What You Should See
Your deployed site should load the frontend (from dist/public/index.html).

Your API routes should work via /api/... (powered by Express).

✅ How to Fix This
Here’s what you need to do to correctly deploy this to Vercel.

🧩 1. Structure the project properly
Recommended layout:

pgsql
Copy
Edit
root/
├── api/
│   └── index.ts        → Serverless function entry point (Express)
├── client/
│   └── index.html      → Vite app entry
├── dist/
│   └── public/         → Vite output (frontend)
├── server/             → All your Express server logic
├── vercel.json
└── package.json
Then use the Express server inside api/index.ts like:

ts
Copy
Edit
// api/index.ts
import app from '../server/index';

export default app;
This is what lets Vercel treat the Express app as a serverless function.

🔧 2. Update vercel.json
Here’s a clean and correct version for your setup:

json
Copy
Edit
{
  "version": 2,
  "functions": {
    "api/index.ts": {
      "runtime": "@vercel/node@4.0.0",
      "launcherType": "node"
    }
  },
  "routes": [
    { "handle": "filesystem" },
    { "src": "/api/(.*)", "dest": "/api/index.ts" },
    { "src": "/(.*)", "dest": "/dist/public/index.html" }
  ]
}
🏗️ 3. Update your Build Settings
In Vercel Project Settings:

Framework Preset: Other

Build Command:

bash
Copy
Edit
npm install && vite build --config vite.config.production.ts && esbuild server/index.ts --platform=node --packages=external --bundle --format=esm --outfile=api/index.js
Output Directory:

arduino
Copy
Edit
dist/public
This command:

Builds your frontend

Bundles your Express app into a single api/index.js file

🛑 Don’t Put Server Files Inside dist/public
Never let your Vite build emit server/index.ts or related code into the public directory. That’s what’s currently causing the source code exposure.

Your vite.config.ts sets outDir: path.resolve(__dirname, 'dist/public'), which is okay — but make sure the server build is kept out of there.
