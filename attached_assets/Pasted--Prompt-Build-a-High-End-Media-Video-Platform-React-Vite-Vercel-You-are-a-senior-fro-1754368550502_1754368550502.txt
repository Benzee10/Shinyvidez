### 🎯 Prompt: Build a High-End Media Video Platform (React + Vite + Vercel)

You are a senior frontend engineer. Build a **modern, fast, and scalable video streaming platform** using **React + Vite**, styled with **Tailwind CSS**, and hosted via **Vercel** with version control via **GitHub**. The site should provide a smooth experience similar to large video platforms, with autoplay previews, responsive design, and smart content discovery.

---

### 🧱 Core Technology Stack

- **Framework**: React + Vite
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui + Framer Motion
- **Content Format**: Markdown (`index.md`) per video
- **Routing**: React Router (or Vite plugin for file-based routing)
- **Deployment**: GitHub + Vercel
- **Playback**: `<video>` tag or embedded iframe sources

### 📁 Folder & Data Structure

Organize videos in a clean folder structure:

```
data/
  creator-name/
    video-title/
      index.md
      01.jpg
```

Each `index.md` contains:

- Frontmatter (title, tags, description, duration, views)
- Video embed or player reference
- Inline cover image and metadata

### 🎥 Video Platform Features

#### 🏠 Homepage

- Video Grid with:
  - Title, duration, tags
  - Hover previews (autoplay muted snippets or animated thumbnails)
- Sections: “Trending”, “Newest”, “Most Watched”
- Filters for tags, creators, or categories

#### 📄 Video Page

- Full video player (embed or native)
- Metadata (description, tags, creator, duration)

### 🎯 Ad Integration (Non-Intrusive)

Inject ad components at three strategic points in each video page:

1. ✅ **Top Ad Slot** – below the video player
2. ✅ **Mid-Content Ad Slot** – between description and tags
3. ✅ **Bottom Ad Slot** – above related videos

- Ads can be image banners, iframes, or call-to-action widgets
- Use a reusable component system like:

```tsx
<AdSlot position="top" />
<AdSlot position="middle" />
<AdSlot position="bottom" />
```

- A sticky **corner video ad widget** can autoplay with a "Learn More" button
