You're seeing your compiled server-side code as raw JavaScript in the browser â€” again. That means Vercel is serving your backend files as static content instead of running them as serverless functions.

ðŸ”¥ What's Going Wrong?
Your server/index.ts and other backend files are being:

Bundled into your frontend build, OR

Served statically from dist/public, OR

Not deployed properly as a serverless function (e.g., api/index.ts)

This is why youâ€™re seeing raw source instead of a working app.

âœ… Correct Architecture for Vercel (Recap)
To deploy a Vite + Express fullstack app on Vercel, you must separate your concerns:

pgsql
Copy
Edit
project/
â”œâ”€â”€ client/              â†’ Vite frontend source
â”œâ”€â”€ server/              â†’ Express app (logic only, not entry point)
â”œâ”€â”€ api/index.ts         â†’ Serverless entry point for Express
â”œâ”€â”€ dist/public/         â†’ Vite build output (frontend)
â”œâ”€â”€ vercel.json          â†’ Routing config
â”œâ”€â”€ package.json
âœ… What You Must Do Now
âœ… 1. Create a Proper Serverless Entry File
Create a new file: api/index.ts
Do not put the whole server code here â€” just import and export your Express app:

ts
Copy
Edit
// api/index.ts
import app from '../server/index';

export default app;
This tells Vercel to treat this as a serverless function, and run the Express app as backend logic.

âœ… 2. Fix Your vercel.json
Update your vercel.json to this:

json
Copy
Edit
{
  "version": 2,
  "functions": {
    "api/index.ts": {
      "runtime": "@vercel/node@4.0.0"
    }
  },
  "routes": [
    { "handle": "filesystem" },
    { "src": "/api/(.*)", "dest": "/api/index.ts" },
    { "src": "/(.*)", "dest": "/dist/public/index.html" }
  ]
}
âœ… 3. Update Your vite.config.production.ts (or vite.config.ts)
Make sure your Vite build does NOT include server/ files.

Keep this:

ts
Copy
Edit
build: {
  outDir: path.resolve(__dirname, 'dist/public'),
  emptyOutDir: true
}
âœ… But make sure you're not copying server files into that output.

âœ… 4. Update Your Build Command
Your server/index.ts is TypeScript and needs to be bundled for Vercel.

Update your Vercel projectâ€™s build command in the dashboard:

bash
Copy
Edit
npm install && vite build --config vite.config.production.ts && esbuild server/index.ts --bundle --platform=node --packages=external --format=esm --outfile=api/index.js
This command does 3 things:

Installs dependencies

Builds the Vite frontend into dist/public

Bundles your Express server into api/index.js

âœ… 5. Add type: "module" to your package.json (if using ESM)
If you're using ES modules (based on your import syntax), you must declare:

json
Copy
Edit
{
  "type": "module",
  "engines": {
    "node": "20.x"
  }
}
